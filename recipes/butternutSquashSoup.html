    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a thick, rich butternut squash soup with tons of flavor. Something I whipped up off the top of my head, with things I had on hand.</p>
        <p>Super easy, quick, and a great way to use squash. An instant hit at my house.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
            <li>1 medium carrot, chopped</li>
            <li>2 medium potatoes, cubed</li>
            <li>1 medium butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cubed</li>
            <li>1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat, and cook onion, celery, carrot, potatoes, and squash until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour in enough chicken stock to cover vegetables.</li>
